## Current features
- Square grid with Flexbox that can handle any number of cells.
- Option to change resolution of grid with user input.
- Space to toggle brush on/off. Esc to clear grid completely.

## TODO/possible extensions
- Add color palette to choose from, possibly color picker.
- Brush mode to Eraser to erase individual cells instead of whole grid - req. refactor of mouseover event handling with state var.
- Animation to rotate or spin grid when grid is erased/first loaded.
- Socket.io to enable collaborative drawing
